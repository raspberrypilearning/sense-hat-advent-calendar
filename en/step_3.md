## Get set up

### Using a Sense HAT

+ Attach the Sense HAT to your Raspberry Pi, and then power it up.

[[[rpi-sensehat-attach]]]

+ Right-click the following links and select **Save as** to download the [starter code](resources/sense-hat-advent-calendar-starter.py){:target="_blank"} and [pictures file](resources/pictures.txt){:target="_blank"}. Save both files in the same folder.

NOTE: The pictures file actually contains text rather than pictures. You will find out how the text becomes pictures when you complete the resource!

+ Open the starter code file using IDLE.

### Using the Trinket Sense HAT emulator

+ Open the [starter trinket](https://trinket.io/python/02b321d2b8){:target="_blank"} which contains both the starter code and the pictures file ready for you to begin.
