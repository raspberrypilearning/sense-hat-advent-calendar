## Add colours

+ In the starter code, look for the the section called **colours** which contains this code:

```python
# Colours
colours = {

  'r' : [255, 0, 0],
  # Add orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet here

  'n' : [135, 80, 22],
  'w' : [255, 255, 255],
  'e' : [0, 0, 0]  # e stands for empty/black

}
```

This is a **dictionary** of colours. Each colour has a letter (e.g. `r` for red) and a matching RGB colour list (e.g. [255, 0, 0] which is red).
