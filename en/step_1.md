## Introduction

Count down to Christmas with your Sense HAT. Your digital advent calendar will display a new image each day between 1st and 24th December.

### What you will make

Press "Enter" on your keyboard to open today's door and see the picture. However there's no cheating with this calendar - if you try to open a door before December 1st you'll have to keep waiting!
