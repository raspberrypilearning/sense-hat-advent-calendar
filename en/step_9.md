## Challenge: add more

+ Display the message "Happy Christmas" if someone opens the advent calendar door on 25 December.

+ Draw your own pictures to display in your advent calendar. You can find out how to create pictures for the LED matrix in the [Pixel pet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/pixel-pet){:target="_blank"} resource.

+ Save a pixel picture as an image, and display it on the Sense HAT on day 25. You could use a site such as [PiskelApp](https://www.piskelapp.com/){:target="_blank"} to draw the picture and save it as a PNG file.

+ Instead of pressing the joystick, can you make the advent calendar open when you tip or shake the Sense HAT? Use the resource [Getting started with the Sense HAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat){:target="_blank"} and its section 'Detecting movement' to help you.

+ Perhaps you could [code some Christmassy music in Sonic Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/compose-tune){:target="_blank"} and have it play when the door opens?
