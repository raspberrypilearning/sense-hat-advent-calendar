## Challenge: stuff

+ Instead of pressing the joystick, can you make the advent calendar open when you tip or shake the Sense HAT? Use the resource [Getting started with the Sense HAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat){:target="_blank"} and the step "Detecting movement" to help you.

+ Display the message "Happy Christmas" if someone opens an advent calendar door on 25th December.

+ Draw your own pictures. You can find out how to create pictures for the LED matrix in the [Pixel Pet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/pixel-pet){:target="_blank"} resource.

+ Perhaps you could code some Christmassy music in [Sonic Pi](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-sonic-pi){:target="_blank"} and have it play when the door opens?
